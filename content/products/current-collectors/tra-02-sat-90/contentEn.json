    "description": "<p>Current collector «TrA 02-SET 90»The current collector (semi-pantograph) is designed to connect the electrical equipment of a tram with an overhead line.</p><p>The maximum admissible continuous current is up to 800 A when moving at speeds up to 90 km/h or up to 160 A when parked. The nominal voltage of the overhead contact system is 550 V.</p><p>The current collector comes with the remote control system for deployment/retraction. It can be deployed or retracted manually in case of an emergency.</p><p>This current collector is used by trams manufactured by LLC “PC Transport Systems”.The current collector can be shipped with the following types of contact strips:</p><ul><li>Aluminum contact strip (605.29.17.066);</li><li>Flat aluminum runner (single runner);</li><li>Carbon contact strips (graphite).</li></ul>",
